    <h2>Why am I reading this?</h2>
    <p>ADN has decided that enough time has passed for you to understand what it is for, how to use it, and what benefits it can bring to people.</p>
    <p>You have already benefited ADN by sending an ad segment or placing a few likes. That's cool, but we cannot win the war alone.</p><p>In order for the extension to be more useful, more people need to know about the project.</p><p>The larger our community - the more ad segments there are, right?</p>
    <h2>Okay, I understand, but how can I help?</h2>
    <p>It's simple: just write an honest review in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adwhorenet/emfkjghgdkajicmnicojahgojkemagcm "target= "_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/adwhore-net/" target= "_blank">Firefox Add-ons</a>.</p>
    <p>This will promote the extension in the Chrome and Firefox stores so that more users can learn about the extension.</p>
    <p>If you have any ideas, suggestions, or you notice an error, please write an email to <a href="mailto:hi@qrlk.me">hi@qrlk.me</a>. The extension is still in the alpha version: at this stage, bugs and flaws are normal.</p>
    <p>If you have skills useful to ADN, participate in client development on <a href="https://github.com/qrlk/adwhore.net" target= "_blank">Github</a> and join our chat in <a href="https://keybase.io/team/adwhore_net" target= "_blank">Keybase</a>.</p>
